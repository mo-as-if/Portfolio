# Visual Arts Portfolio Website
A collection of passion projects, past design commissions and original photography. Instead of showcasing this work on a social media platform, or even using a website builder/hosting tool, I took the liberty of designing and building out my own original website. An ongoing project that is far from complete. As I grow my skills, creativity and industry knowledge, so will this web catalog of my work. - Mo Asif
